# Manual Steps to Fix Vercel MIME Type Issues

If you encounter MIME type issues when deploying to Vercel, follow these steps:

## 1. Check the Browser Console

Look for errors like:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

## 2. Create a New Project in Vercel Dashboard

The most reliable fix is to create a new project through the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure as follows:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Install Command: npm install
   - Environment Variables: Add DEPLOY_TARGET=vercel
5. Click "Deploy"

## 3. Check File Serving

After deployment, verify that JavaScript files are served with the correct MIME type:
- Visit your deployed site
- Open browser dev tools (F12)
- Go to the Network tab
- Filter by "JS"
- Reload the page
- Check the "Content-Type" header for .js files - it should be "application/javascript"

## 4. If Issues Persist

If problems continue:
1. Try a different browser
2. Clear browser cache
3. Add additional meta tags in index.html:
   ```html
   <meta http-equiv="X-Content-Type-Options" content="nosniff">
   ```
4. Consider using an older Vite version (4.x) which may have better compatibility with Vercel

## 5. Last Resort

If all else fails, consider deploying to Netlify or GitHub Pages as alternatives.
