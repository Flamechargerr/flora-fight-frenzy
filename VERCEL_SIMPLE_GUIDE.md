# Vercel Deployment - Simple Approach

Follow these steps to successfully deploy your Flora Fight Frenzy game to Vercel:

## 1. Create a New Project via Vercel Dashboard

The most reliable way to deploy Vite projects to Vercel is through their dashboard:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure as follows:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Root Directory: ./

5. Click "Deploy"

This approach lets Vercel handle all the configuration automatically, avoiding MIME type issues.

## 2. After Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. Test your game thoroughly
2. Check the browser console for any errors
3. Verify that all assets load correctly

## 3. Additional Configuration

If your deployment works correctly but you'd like to add custom domains or other features:

1. Go to the project settings in your Vercel dashboard
2. Set up a custom domain if desired
3. Configure environment variables if needed

## 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Vercel's deployment logs
2. Ensure you've selected "Vite" as the framework preset
3. Try a fresh deployment from the dashboard
4. Consider deploying to GitHub Pages as an alternative
