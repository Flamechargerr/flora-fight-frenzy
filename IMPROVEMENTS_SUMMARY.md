# Flora Fight Frenzy - Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all the improvements made to address the user's feedback about the Flora Fight Frenzy game.

## Issues Addressed

1. **No automatic sun generation** - Fixed by implementing authentic Plants vs Zombies timing

3. **Looks kiddish** - Transformed to authentic Plants vs Zombies appearance

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. Automatic Sun Generation
- **Natural Sun**: Falls from sky every 10-15 seconds (authentic PvZ timing)
- **Sunflower Production**: Each sunflower produces sun every 24 seconds (authentic PvZ timing)
- **Sun Cleanup**: Automatically disappears after 15 seconds if not collected
- **Implementation**: Located in `src/hooks/useGameState.ts`

### 2. Lawnmower Mechanics
- **Activation Zone**: Lawnmowers activate when zombies reach position 80

  - Plants: `.pvz-plant` with health bars
  - Zombies: `.pvz-zombie` with eating animations

### 4. GitHub Pages Deployment
